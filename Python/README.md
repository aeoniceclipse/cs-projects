# Python
 Progression Record

This is meant to record my learning progress in Python.

This folder [and further if applicable] can act, in a way, as a portfolio of my Python programming, depending on learned topics. As I am self-directed, some files may be incomplete or disorganized as I move through concepts; there may be skipped or added content [from what may be expected] based on my knowledge and experimentation levels.

Starting content was created by following the material from learnpython.org.
