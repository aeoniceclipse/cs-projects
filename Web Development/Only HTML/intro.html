	<p>
		These pages are meant to record my learning progress in web development.

	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>
		This page [and further] can act, in a way, as a portfolio of my web design and programming, depending on learned topics.<br>
		As I am self-directed, some files may be incomplete or disorganized as I move through concepts; there may be skipped or added 
		content [from what may be expected] based on my knowledge and experimentation levels.<br>
		To stay within the 'record taking' realm, this intro page was based on guidelines from a Web Development course on Udemy by 
		Dr. Angela Yu.
