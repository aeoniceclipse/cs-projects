# Rust

I became interested in Rust some years ago from hearing it was a newer and safer language. It seemed to be becoming popular [according to the TIOBE index] at the time so I wanted to start learning it early. I also joined the developers' Discord to stay on top of the language.

This was started by following the book material from rust-lang.org.
