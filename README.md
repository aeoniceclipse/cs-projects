 Progression record

This is meant to record my learning progress in my technological interests.

Each included folder can act, in a way, as a portfolio of the folder's subject. It will include a readme of such subject and contents, and likely further folders for organization.

As I am self-directed, some files may be incomplete or disorganized as I move through concepts; there may be skipped or added content [from what may be expected] based on my knowledge and experimentation levels.
